# School-Database-Manager
A Full Stack React App with Rest API to provide a way for users to administer a school database containing information 
about courses: users can interact with the database by retrieving a list of courses, viewing detail for a specific 
course, as well as creating, updating and deleting courses in the database.
In addition, the project will require users to create an account and sign in to make changes to the database. 

#### To run the app:
1. Open a separate terminal for the `api` and then the `client` folder.
2. In the `api` terminal, run `npm install` to install the necessary modules.
3. Now, run `npm start` in the `api` terminal.
4. In the client terminal, run ` npm install` to install the necessary dependencies and modules.
5. After installation, run `npm start`. The app should open an instance on the web to view the project.
6. If a new instance did not open automatically, copy this `http://localhost:3000/` to view the project.
