# School-Database-Manager
A Full Stack React App with Rest API to provide a way for users to administer a school database containing information about courses: users can interact with the database by retrieving a list of courses, viewing detail for a specific course, as well as creating, updating and deleting courses in the database.
In addition, the project will require users to create an account and sign in to make changes to the database. Implementing these features will push your React skills to new heights.
